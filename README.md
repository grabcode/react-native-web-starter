## Getting *quickly* started

As of today, React Native for Web, let's call it RN4Web, is still pretty recent, and could use some more documentations, along with contributions.

This repo is an attempt to make it easier for anyone to launch, experiment and publish a RN4Web App.

### Install
```
git clone https://github.com/grabcode/react-native-web-starter.git projectname
cd projectname
rm -rf .git
npm install
```

### Run
`npm run dev` - your app is accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

You can also enjoy [React Storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook) running `npm run storybook` and open `http://localhost:9001`


### Build
TODO

## Tools

React Native for Web runs in the browser, hence get out of the box full dev tools supports.

In the future, RN4Web Starter may come with some flavour such as Redux and its amazing [tool suite](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).

## About React Native for Web

[React Native for Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) is born from the brilliant mind of a member of the React Native community. Some would say it had to happen, many reasons begging for such project to get started.

React Native tends to unify iOS and Android, and soon Universal Windows developer under one banner, sort of the Wardens of the Native.

Well, following that GoT analogy, React Native for Web is the Wardens of the Web, unifying any React developer under a common set of values.
